# Game Cycle Tracker - Excel Tool
## Description
The Game Cycle Tracker is a powerful Excel tool designed to assist teams in monitoring their performance during game sessions. It tracks each cycle, collects relevant data about the elements gathered, and stores the results for each game session.

In the future, this project will be expanded and modified to support the scouting process, allowing teams to store and analyze data on other teams' performance as well.

## Features:
Track Cycles: Each cycle starts when the "Start Cycle" button is pressed and ends when an element is added (such as "Add Algae" or "Add Coral L2") or manually finished.
Scoring System: Each element added corresponds to specific points, which are added to the total score of the cycle and game.
Time Tracking: The duration of each cycle is tracked and stored. The total time of the game is limited to 2:15 minutes (135 seconds), at which point the data is transferred to the "Games" sheet.
Game Summary: The "Games" sheet records:
The number of the game
The number of cycles
The time spent in each cycle
The element that ended each cycle (or "error" if manually finished)
The average cycle duration
The total number of elements collected
The total points scored
The game status ("Bad", "Average", or "Good" based on the number of elements collected)
Data Preservation: Every time the game is formatted (using the "Format" button), previous data is saved along with the date and time of the formatting, ensuring no data is lost between sessions.
Created by Yasmin Bzra:
This tool was designed and developed by Yasmin Bzra, a 15-year-old competitor from the FRC Team 9219 - Nine Tails. She created this Excel tool to help her team and others in their competitive efforts, with a focus on tracking in-game performance and improving cycle management.

## Usage
Starting a New Cycle:
Press the "Start Cycle" button to begin the cycle.
Add in-game elements (such as "Add Algae" or "Add Coral L2") to finalize the cycle and score points.
Alternatively, you can manually end the cycle by selecting "End Cycle".
Formatting:
Click the "Format" button to reset the game for a new session. This will clear current data and start a new game while saving the previous game’s data.
Data Tracking:
Each cycle’s duration is tracked and stored.
The tool automatically logs the total number of cycles, elements collected, and points scored during each game.
Setup
To use the Game Cycle Tracker, simply open the Excel file and start using the buttons as instructed. No installation is required.
